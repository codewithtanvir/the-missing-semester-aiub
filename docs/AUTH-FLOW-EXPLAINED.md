## 🔐 How Authentication Works

### Flow Diagram:
```
Your Site (aiubfiles.app)
    ↓
Click "Login with Microsoft"
    ↓
Redirect to Microsoft Login
    ↓
"Choose an account to continue to zkjoqhkwdvotsavwqwkt.supabase.co" ← YOU ARE HERE
    ↓
Select your AIUB account
    ↓
Microsoft authenticates
    ↓
Redirect to Supabase (zkjoqhkwdvotsavwqwkt.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback)
    ↓
Supabase processes authentication
    ↓
Redirect back to YOUR SITE (aiubfiles.app/auth/callback)
    ↓
✅ You're logged in!
```

## 📝 What to Do Next

### Step 1: Choose Your Account
- Click on your AIUB Microsoft account
- Or any account you want to use for testing

### Step 2: Grant Permissions (if asked)
- Microsoft may ask to share profile info
- Click "Accept" or "Yes"

### Step 3: Wait for Redirect
- You'll be redirected through:
  1. Supabase (processes auth token)
  2. Back to your site (aiubfiles.app)

### Step 4: You Should Be Logged In!
- Check top-right corner for your name/profile
- You should have access to the app

## 🎯 Why It Says "supabase.co"

**This is NORMAL!**

Microsoft shows the **authentication service** domain (Supabase), not your app domain. This is because:

1. Your app uses Supabase for authentication
2. Microsoft OAuth redirects to Supabase first
3. Supabase then redirects back to your app
4. This is standard OAuth flow for third-party auth

**It's like:**
- Your app is the "store"
- Supabase is the "payment processor"
- Microsoft is the "bank"

The bank shows the payment processor's name, not the store name.

## ✅ Verification

After logging in, verify:

### Check 1: You're Redirected Back
- URL should be: `https://aiubfiles.app` (or /admin if admin)
- NOT stuck on supabase.co

### Check 2: You're Logged In
- See your name/email in header
- Can access protected pages
- Can navigate the app

### Check 3: Sessions Persist
- Refresh the page
- You should stay logged in
- No need to login again

---

## 🔧 If Login Fails

### Error: "Invalid Redirect URL"

**Fix:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Authentication → URL Configuration
3. Ensure these are added:
   ```
   https://aiubfiles.app/auth/callback
   https://www.aiubfiles.app/auth/callback
   ```

### Error: "Unable to verify PKCE"

**Fix:**
1. Clear browser cookies
2. Try in incognito mode
3. Try again

### Error: Stuck on Supabase Page

**Fix:**
1. Check Supabase redirect URLs (see above)
2. Check callback page exists: `src/app/auth/callback/page.tsx`
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)

## 🎓 For Students

When students see this screen, they should:

1. **Choose their AIUB Microsoft account**
   - Look for: `student@aiub.edu` or similar
   - If not logged into Microsoft, they'll need to login first

2. **Grant permissions**
   - Microsoft will ask to share basic profile info
   - This is safe and necessary
   - Click "Accept"

3. **Wait for redirect**
   - Don't close the window
   - Don't click back
   - Wait ~2-5 seconds

4. **You'll be logged in!**
   - Should see your name in the app
   - Can access course materials
